### Formating snippets
# center an unordered list
ul {
   text-align: center;}
ul li {
   display: inline-block;}

# make unordered list vertical
li {
    list-style-type: none;
    display: inline;}

# show sepeartor between unordered list
li + li:before{
    content: " | ";
    padding: 0 3px;}

# resize a block element and center it
(if using only "width" => when the window is to small - the browser resolves this with a horizontal scrollbar)
(so its better to use "max-width" => this reduces the width when the windows is / becomes to small)
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto; 

# let a image float right - and let the text float around it in the left and bottom area around the picture
img {
  float: right;
  margin: 0 0 1em 1em;}

# when floating and the image is bigger then the element use this so the element is adjusted to the image heigth
.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;}

# nav menue on the left side - with several section beside the nav in the right area
(with a percentage parameter - better then fixed px-amounts especially when using smaller windows)
nav {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;}
section {
  margin-left: 25%;}

# show all elements in a div-block flexible as inline
div {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 1em;}

# styling link based on state
a:link {...}		=> format link when not allready clicked
a:visited {...}		=> format link when allready clicked
a:hover {...}		=> format link when hovered over with the mouse

# center the whole site in the middle
body {
	width: 75%;
	margin: 0 auto;}

# make media scalable
img, video, canvas {
	max-width: 100%;
}



### CSS
should go in seperate file (better than inline or in the head)
css statements are called "rules"
resetting all browser-styles: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
normalize the alle browser-styles: github.com/necolas/normalize.css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">    # link the html-file to the css-file
/* comment */

p {                                             # syntax of the css statement / rule
    color: red;                                 => (p => selector, color:red; => declaration)
}                                               => color => property, red => value)

p {                                             # set rule with 2 declerations for p => red and bold
    color: red;
    font_weight: bold;
}

### Cascade Rules (but Specificity overrules - see below)
p {                                             # cascading rules (from top to bottom, step by step)
    color: red;                                 =>output is blue+bold
    font_weight: bold;
}
p {
    color: blue;
}



### Font Definition
https://fonts.google.com/
taken from google fonts for example (take fonts and then create link in upper right corner for the link
<head>                                          # define in html in the header
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?familiy=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@300;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylessheet">
</head>
p {
    font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Helvetica", sans-serif;			# Helvetica and sans-serif are the fallback fonts when Source Sans Pro is not loading
	font-weight: 700;													# how thick / bold the font is
}



### Parent > Child Relationsships
Overview Complex Selectors see: https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/
# direct parent/child relationship
<section>
    <p>hello, twitch!</p>
</section>                                      # direct parent relationsship > child connection with ">"
section > p {                                   # direct child connection (only the p which are direct unter section
    color:red;                                  # p is the direct child of section
}

# normal parent/child realtionship
<section>
    <article>
        <p>hello, twitch!</p>
    </article>
</section>                                      # normal parent child connection (ignores deepeness)
section p {                                     # all connections above (when there is a p - somewhere on a level - in the section)
    color:red;                                  # p is the grandchild of section / somewhere a child of section
}

# Sibling Relationship
<section>
    <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
	<p>Hello, YouTube!</p>
</section>										# previous sibling + next sibling
p + p {											# format is used when two <p>s are after each other
	color: red;									# only the second p will get red
}



### Selectors and Combinations
h1 {...}										# Type Selector - Select one specific type 
* {...}											# Universal Selector - Select everything
.box {...}										# Class Selector - Select specific class
#unique {...}									# ID Selectors - Select specific ID
Attribute selector	a[title] {...}				# Attribute Selectors - Select elements which have the attribute "title"
p:first-child {...}								# Pseudo Class Selector - Select elements with special state (eg. first-child, hover, focus, clicked,...)
p::first-line {...}								# Pseudo Elements Selector - Style a specific part of the selected element (eg. first-letter, first-line,...)
article p										# Descendant combinator - all connections above (when there is a p - somewhere on a level - in the article)
article > p										# Child Combinator - direct child connection (only the p which are direct unter article)
h1 + p											# Adjacent Sibling - format is used when a <p> is following directly after a <h1>
h1 ~ p											# General Sibling - selects any <p> which is following somewhere after a <h1>
article p span {...}							# selects any <span> that is inside a <p>, which is inside an <article>
h1 + ul + p {...}								# selects any <p> that comes directly after a <ul>, which comes directly after an <h1>
body h1 + p .special {...}						# select elements with class "special" which are somwhere after p which is directly after h1 which is somewhere in the body 	



### Classes	
<section>
	<p class="robot">Hello, Twitch!</p>
	<p id="zebra" class="bob">Hello, YouTube!</p>
	<p class="bob">Goodbye!</p>	
</section>										# class is used for formating many different elements	
.bob {											
	color: red;
}	
.class1.class2 {...}							# both classes have to be in the SAME element
p.class1.class2 {...}							# both classes have to be in the SAME element - only for p-elements
.class1 .class2 {...}							# the parent-element has to be class1 and the child-element class2
section.class1 h2.class2 {...}					# the parent-element <section> has to be class1 and the child-element <h2> class2
.class1,.class2 {...}							# one of the classes have to be in the element
p.class1.class2, a.class2 {...}					# rule is for <p> with class1+class2 or <a> with class2
body article.class1 h2.class2.class3 {...}		# h2, which have class2+classe3 in h2, their parent has class1, and the parent is in body
aside.aExtra h3									# rule for <h3> which have a parent-element <aside> with class aExtra



### IDs
<section>
	<p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
	<p id="zebra">Hello, YouTube!</p>
</section>										# id is used for formating unique elements
#zebra {color: red;}							# can used only ONE time - only one id per element - nothing else can have this id
#class1,#class2 {...}							# one of the ids have to be in the element
body section.top h2#rhino {...}					# h2, which has id=rhino, the parent has class=top and the parent is in body
section#aMilk h2								# rule for <h2> which have a parent-element <section> with id aMilk



### Inline Style / !important
.bob {
	color: red !important;						# with !important this style get the maximum priority / overwrites everything
}												# not often used - eg. in cases of immediate urgency to show something - when a error is not found cxurrently



### Specificity
https://down4kode.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/css-specificity-calculator/
# defines the priority which styles can overwrite which style
# priority has the style which came later - but only when the specificity is equal or higher!
1 point for tags
10 points for classes
100 points for ids
1000 points for Inline Style
p{}								=> 1 point (1 tag)
#zebra{} 						=> 100 points (1 id)
section .bob { }				=> 11 points (1 tag + 1 class)
.bob{ !important }				=> 1010 points (1 class + 1 other)
section1,section2 .bob { }		=> 11 points (1 tag + 1 class) for section1 and for section2



### Pseudo Classes
overview see: https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/
special classes which are dinamically populated as a result of user actions of document structure
a:link{...}								# format link when not clicked
a:visited{...}							# format link when allready clicked
a:hover{...}							# format link when hoovered over it
li:first-child							# Selects an element that is the first within a parent
li:last-child							# Selects an element that is the last within a parent
p:first-of-type							# Selects an element that is the first of its type within a parent
p:last-of-type							# Selects an element that is the last of its type within a parent



### Box Model / Boxing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_box_model#/media/File:Boxmodell-detail.png
every element is a box - box in the middle
box has a heigth and width - eg. 100px*100px
padding outside the box - between box and border (top,right,bottom,left)
border (outside padding) (top,right,bottom,left)
margin (outside border) (top,right,bottom,left)
block boxes => eg. h1, p - break to new line, fill the maximum available space, width and heigth will be respected
inline boxex => eg. a, span, em, strong - will not break to new line, use only the minium space, width/heigth will not apply
*{box-sizing: border-box}					# With this statement every sizing is included with the border


 
### Layouts - Floating
old layouting - not state of the art!
element tries to got as much up to the top - and as much left (or right according if floated left or right)
normaly everything will float to the left

Positioning Content
<header>...</header>						# example1 - without cass all the elements will be positoned from top to bottom
<section>...</section>
<aside>...</aside>
<footer>...</footer>

section {									# with that css-command section and aside will be on the same level
	float:left;								# section on the left side and aside on the right side
}
aside {
	float:right;
}

section {									# with that css-command section and aside will be on the same level
	float:left;								# section on the left side with 63% of the space and aside with 30% of the space
	margin 0 1.5%;							# both have a margin outside the element
	width: 63%
}
aside {
	float:right;
	margin 0 1.5%;
	width: 30%
}	
footer {
	clear: both;							# after the float - the floats have to be cleared to get the old normal vertically float
}
	
<header>...</header>						# example2 - without cass all the elements will be positoned from top to bottom
<section>...</section>
<section>...</section>
<section>...</section>
<footer>...</footer>	

section {									# with that all 3 section elements will float left
	float: left								# so they are horizontal alligned side by side
	margin 0 1.5%;							# width has to be adjusted accordingly
	width: 30%
}
footer {
	clear: both;							# after the float - the floats have to be cleared to get the old normal vertically float
}



### Layout - Flexbox
# css-tricks.com: Complete Guide To Flexbox
section { display: flex; }						# initialize flexcontainer (parent element of the flex items)
section { justify-content: flex-start; }		# put elements to the max left - horizontally
section { justify-ccontent: flex-end; }			# put elements to the max right - horizontally
section { justify-content: center; }			# center the elements horizontally
section { justify-content: space-around; }		# place elements with space around horizontally
section { justify-content: space-between; }		# place elements with space between the elements horizontally
section { align-items: flex-start; }			# align elements at the top vertically
section { align-items: flex-end; }				# align elements at the bottom vertically
section { align-items: center; }				# center the elements vertically
section { align-self: flex-end; }				# align individual element at the bottom
section { flex-direction: row; }				# items are placed to the text direction
section { flex-direction: row-reverse; }		# items are placed opposite to the text direction
section { flex-direction: column; }				# items are placed top to bottom
section { flex-direction: column-reverse; }		# items are placed top to bottom  oppostie to the text direction
section { flex-wrap: nowrap; }					# show every item in a single line in the flexcontainer section
section { flex-wrap: wrap; } 					# wrap elements to next line in the flexcontainer section
section { flex-flow: row wrap; }				# combination from direction + row (same as flex-direction:	row and flex-wrap: wrap)
article { flex: 1 200px; }						# gives the flex-item 1 proportion value (when there are 3 items - every item gets the same space)
article:nth-of-type(3) { flex: 2 200px; }		# gives the 3rd item 2 proportion (item 1+2 get 1/4 of the space - item 3 gets 1/2 of the space)
button:first-child { align-self: flex-end; }	# overwrites the vertical position of the item in the flexcontainer
button:first-child { order: 1; }				# change the order of the first item (everything has order 0 - with 1 it goes to the very right position)
button:last-child { order: -1; }				# change the order of the last item (everything has order 0 - with -1 it goes to the very first position)



### Layout - Grid
display: grid;									# Define grid for the layouting
grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;		# Define 3 fixed columns with 200px each
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;				# Define 3 flexible columns with fr-units (define 3 columns with max possible place)
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);			# 2nd way: Define 3 flexible columns with fr-units (define 3 columns with max possible place)
grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;				# Define 3 flexible columns with fr-units (4 spaces - 1st column takes 2; 2nd+3rd colujmn take 1)
grid-template-columns:							# Create as many columns as will fit into the container
	repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));			
grid-gap: 20px;									# Define gap between the elements
grid-auto-rows: 100px;							# Define heigth of the row
grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);			# Define heigth of the row (100px is minimum, auto expand to fit the content)
grid-column 1 / 3;								# Use for element grid-columns 1 - 3
grid-row: 1;									# Use for element grid-row 1



### Responsive Design
Running the page on different / smaller devices
- Fluid - everything sized with percentage (no fixed measures)
	=> looks more or less good on every windows-size
- Elastic - using em and rem (em looks at the parents fontsize and use this as a base / rem looks at the html-element)
	(set a standard font-size as a base for the whole document)
	=> em: the change has only to be done at the one font-size decleration
	=> rem: the change has only to be done at the font-size from the html
	=> font-size: 62.5%; /* font-size 1em = 10px bei normaler Browser-Einstellung */
	(so everything would response to the default font size from the actual user)
	(only changing the font-size central when changes)
- Content Decision - Mobile First or Desktop to Mobile
	=> first think about the design on mobile (and then bigger and bigger from Tablet to fully desktop)
	=> or make it the other way (desktop design first and then shrinking to mobile version)
	=> decide what should be shown on mobile devices and what not
	=> using media queries

### Media Queries
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {			# smartphones: this rule get only be used when the device width is between 0 and 600 pixel
	h1 { color: blue; }              }
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {			# tablets: this rule is used when the width is greater 600px
    .middle{color: yellow; }         }
@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {			# desktop: this rule is used when the width is greater 900px
    .middle{color: yellow; }         }
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px){	# this rule is used when the width is between 600px and 900px
	img {border: 2px solid red;}     }



section {
	height: 200px;
	border 1px solid black;
	flex: 1;				# use the full length of the width	
}
main,.bottom {				# arranges elements in main and class bottom with flex-system
	display: flex;
}

Important addition to the template-columns:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	=> enables the windows to be zoomed
	(never set initial-scale to none - zooming would be not possible)



###Animating, Transform
transform: matrix(1,2,3,4,5,6);					# combines the follwing 6 rules
transform: translate (120px, 50%);				# move left/right, up/down4kode
transform: scale (2, 0.5);						# change the scale of the object
transform: rotate (0.5turn);					# rotate object (possible for any axes (rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ)
transform: skew(30deg, 20deg);					# skew object
transform: scale(0.5) translate(-100%,-100%)	# combine some transformations

@keyframes xyzAction{							# responsible for the animation - is corresponding to a class definition (see below)
	0% {transform: rotateZ(0deg)};				# at 0% of the animation nothing should change on the z-axe
	50% {transform: rotateZ(180deg)};			# at 50% of the antimaton the z-axe should rotate 180deg		
	100% {transform: rotateZ(360deg)};			# at 100% of the antimaton the z-axe should rotate 360deg		
}

.letRip{}										# define the class for the @keyframe above
animation-name: xyzAction;						# Name of the keyframe (puts together the setup to the keyframe)
animation-iteration-count: infinite;			# How many times the animation runs (infinite or eg. 5 for 5 times)
animation-duration: 500ms;						# Lenght of one duration of the animation eg. 500ms or 0.5sec
animation-function: linear;						# Animation is progressing linear
animation-function: easy-in-out;				# Animation is progressing faster to the end
animation-function: step(5,end);				# Animation is progressing in steps (not smooth)
animation-play-state: running;					# Possible values are runnning or pause (can be used with javacript to start/stop)
animation-delay									# How long the start of the animation delays
animation-direction:							# Control of the progression - forward, backward, alternate
animation-fill-mode



### CSS Template - style.css
see Learning-Documentation - folder "Template HTML_CSS_JS"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
	=> normalize the different browser standard styling



### Performance and Organization
https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/
- keep selector shorthand
- use no or less ids - better classes
- do not use elements before classes (Bad: article.feat Good: .feat)
- reuse styles whereever its possible
- compress files with gzip
- compress / convert images (program PNGGauntlet)




### Google Chrome Hacks
select the width or heigth - press rigth strg - up/down 	=>   live the selected element in the browser



### Preprocessors
https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/preprocessors/
# Haml => Preprocessor for HTML
(Ruby must be installed before)
gem install haml				# Installation of haml
haml index.haml index.html		# Compile the .haml-file to html

# Sass
(more like a programming language with expressions, loops, if-statements,...)
gem install sass				# Installation of Sass

Many other preprocessors like Jade, Slim, LESS, Stylus, CoffeeScript

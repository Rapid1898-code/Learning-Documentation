Once an order is marked as completed, a buyer has 10 days to leave a review. 
Once submitted, you will receive a notification, and also have the opportunity to leave 
a review about working with the buyer. At this stage, you can't see a buyer's review. 
Once both seller and buyer have completed their reviews, or the 10 days have passed, 
all reviews are made public.

###### Tipps from LeonNoel during 100Devs

Direct applications makes no sense (like drowing the application in the dustbin...)
Stranger => Acquaintance => Friend => Referral => Coworker

Places to meet:
- meetup.com / local boards
- google interest + conference
- local is always better
- tell friends and family what you are doing (eg. web development)

Normal Follow Up:
Meet => EMail => Linkedin => Twitter
never send a linkedin-invitation without a message...

Coffe Chat Follow Up:
after 1 week: email follow up
after 2 weeks: email folow up 2
after 1 month: last email

Use a sheet for tracking the networking
Where met? When? What was it all about (programming, football, hobby,..) Next Steps?
